# QuantumControlML 
This repository investigates the topic of Machine Learning as it relates to Quantum Control to determine if it has a use supporting ongoing research. The programs contained here will explore the core concepts of machine learning and how they are implemented. The research and the limited results obtained suggest an effective increase in analysis speed and efficiency when machine learning algorithms are applied to mathematical models.<br/>
In this repository, are two programs, the first is a basic example of a deep learning algorithm which uses machine learning to play a pole balancing game and the other a more extensive deep supervised learning network to be used for solving a qunatum trap frequency problem.<br/>
The second program contains two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the first network is used to solve a classification problem to build a database for the second network to be able try to solve a regression problem to solve the quantum problem.<br/>
While most of the program was put together seperately, it is important to note that the final program does not function, as I could not build the database correctly. Despite this however, it is still a significant example of how deep learning algorithms and machine learning may be used to tackle a quantum problem.<br/>
